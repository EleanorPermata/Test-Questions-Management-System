# Test Question Management System (TQMS)
This repository contains the source code and data files for a **Python-based Test Questions Management System (TQMS)** developed as part of a group assignment for the **Programming with Python (102023-MAL)** module at Asia Pacific University.

## ‚ùóOverview

The TQMS is a terminal-based system that allows academic admins, lecturers, and exam unit personnel to manage user accounts, questions, and exam papers efficiently. The system emphasizes modular programming, file-based data storage, and user-specific role functionality.

## ‚ùìHow to Run
1. Download all the files in repository.
2. Ensure all files are within the same folder.
3. Use any Python compiler to compile (e.g., VSCode).
3. Run the `Test Question Management System_Final.py` file.

## Features

## üìÇData Storage & Structure
- All data is stored in plain `.txt` files for simplicity.

- Questions, subjects, and exam sets are stored in separate text files.
- Terminal-based interface with no GUI (focus on programming logic).
